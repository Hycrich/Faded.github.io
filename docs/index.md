# Welcome to the Faded's

This is a personal website for learning and sharing, and I am eagerly looking forward to you to contribute.
In this website, I will share my learning notes and resources in CS and other courses that I'm used to be struggled for or now struggling for, and I will also share my personal projects and inspirations.
